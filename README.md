# Project_HBC_Lipid_Analysis
Evolution of Lipid Composition in Humpback Chub from 2016 to 2021

## Our Goal
In this project, we focus on a detailed statistical analysis of the Humpback Chub (HBC), honing in on the evolution of its lipid composition (percent wet mass of lipid) over a five-year period, from 2016 to 2021. This study aims to replicate and refine the analytical approach of Dibble et al.'s paper, specifically tailoring it to assess changes in lipid dynamics within HBC. Through this specialized analysis, we seek to provide a deeper understanding of the physiological adaptations and health of the Humpback Chub, offering valuable insights for conservation efforts and species management.
